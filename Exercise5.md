	Complex contagion is different from simple contagion because there is an acceptance threshold. Whereas, only one connection is necessary for something to spread (e.g. a virus, a habit…), complex contagion requires a certain percentage of connections to be exposed in order for it to spread successfully. Therefore, a complex contagion will eventually affect all nodes in a network regardless, the only uninfected individuals will be those without any connections (of any degree) to the first case. When faced with a complex contagion, it is possible for the spread to stop if some parts of the network are too knit together or too isolated; hence the importance of staying at home to flatten the curve. For example, one of the examples Centola gives in their book extract “The Myth of the Influencer” is how CEO’s of large have much higher complex contagion thresholds than start up founders; when new technologies start spreading, higher ups are usually the last to adopt them as they need the people below them to adopt them first in in order for the technology to be perceived as trustworthy, hence the high contagion complexity and the difficulty of spread among CEO’s. Another example is that Warren Buffet only started using a smartphone a couple of years ago, finally ditching his fifteen-year-old flip phone.
	Similarly, organizations can also behave in a similar matter. Diffusion of behaviors is defined as the promotion of a certain type of behavior (or likewise, prevention thereof) within a certain group of people, such as within employees of an organization. Thus, behaviors can be hard to encourage, let alone adopt universally, if the complex contagion has high enough barriers. Given the prevalence of clusters (with few connections in between) among employees of an organization, it can be challenging for such habits to be adopted by tightly knit groups of colleagues. Thus, people whose behavior should spread or be copied should make multiple connections with people in the same subgroup or department in order to make the target behavior spread successfully. This is what is known as groupthink, when too many people think alike, they will ignore the behaviors of people outside their groups, causing incidents such as The Challenger in 1986 where the engineers’ advice not to launch was ignored.
	Moreover, prosocial behavior is a set of voluntary actions aimed at benefiting others, thus requiring complex cognition as they are hard to adopt. Connections between subgroups are called bridges of social capital as they make the network be connected just enough, to both avoid groupthink and ensure spreading. A “small world network” what scientists call this sweet spots with bonds within subgroups as well as occasional ones between them. Likewise, learning can also spread the same way, like for example, one is more likely to learn if most of their friends do as well. However, just as good habits can spread, bad habits can spread too. So in order to prevent the spread of toxic behavior through an organization, people with good behavior should be incentivized to make more connections and more importantly to also bridge different subgroups in order to prevent a healthy work environment.
